## Hapi + MySQL Node REST API

This is a REST API I'm making using the Hapi.js web-framework and MySQL as database. 

I chose Hapi over Express as the JavaScript community tends to prefer it for developing APIs. 

It's a bit verbose, but worth it, as far as I've seen.

I'll add more as the project proceeds. 

I'll be sure to unit-test.
